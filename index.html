    <p class="center">References</p>
    <p>is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a 
      series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are 
      based on characters that appear in American comic books published by 
      Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short 
      films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like 
      the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing 
      over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>
